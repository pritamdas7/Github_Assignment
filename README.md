# Git/Github Project for Certification

In this project, we will learn the basics of Git version control by creating and managing repositories locally and on GitHub. We will perform essential Git operations, including staging, committing, branching, and merging. By the end of this project, we will have a clear understanding of how to work with Git and GitHub to manage code collaboratively and efficiently.
